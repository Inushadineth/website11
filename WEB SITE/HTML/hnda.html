 <h2><ul>
<li>Higher National Diploma in Accountancy (HNDA)</h2></ul>
<p1>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The HNDA programme is the first professional 
accounting course introduced in Sri Lanka. It was started in 1943
 as the National Diploma in Accountancy with the aim of detecting 
 and preventing frauds, errors and malpractices in Ceylon Tea Estates 
 and Ceylon Railway. Then, it was converted to a Higher National Diploma
 in Accountancy (HNDA) in 1946. It has been gaining popularity over the 
 time and in 1963, an evening course was also introduced in order to meet 
 the market demand. The HNDA was considered as an alternative to B.Com 
 degree offered by the National Univercities of Sri Lanka by the Public
 Administration Circular No.46/90 of 1990. The mandate for auditing 
 enterprises excluding public sector organizations as certified auditors 
 was granted to the HNDA holders in 1968.Since 2001, HNDA programme has
 been conducted by the Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technological
 Education (SLIATE) at the Advanced Technological Institutes Island wide..
